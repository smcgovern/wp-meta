Barebone Wordpress Theme + Plugins

Tools Utilized:
-Twitter Bootstrap
-JQuery (via Google CDN)
-Advanced Custom Fields
-WP Blade

I suggest cloning repo, renaming theme folder to something more client-friendly, such as your project's name, and customizing from there. This isn't meant to look good out of box, its a skeleton to build upon.
